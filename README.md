## Installation

The repo [whizjs/netlify-identity-demo-vue](https://github.com/whizjs/netlify-identity-demo-vue) has a demo of how to use Netlify Identity with Vue using the [Netlify Identity widget](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-identity-widget)
that is deployed at <https://netlify-identity-demo-vue.netlify.app/> but the demo currently (2023) fails when signup.

When trying to install the dependencies using node v18.8 and npm 9.2 I with yarn  got the following error:

```bash
[1/2] â¡€ fsevents
warning Error running install script for optional dependency: "/Users/casianorodriguezleon/campus-virtual/2223/learning/netlify-learning/netlify-identity-demo-vue/node_modules/fsevents: Command failed.
```

Same thing with node v16. However the 

```
yarn serve
```
command works in v16 but not in v18.

**When tried with npm it worked with v18! but the `npm run serve` failed**

When tried npm with node v16 failed but then a `yarn install`succeeded and then `yarn serve` worked.
